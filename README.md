### 🌐 My First Web Page

Welcome to **SearchAlgorithmsVlab**, a Virtual Labs project designed to explore an **adaptive search algorithm** that automatically selects between **linear search** for unsorted arrays and **binary search** for sorted arrays!

---

## 🛠 Features

- **Adaptive Search Algorithm**: Dynamically detects if an array is sorted or unsorted and chooses the most efficient search method accordingly.
- **Linear Search**: Applies sequential searching through each element in the array when data is unsorted.
- **Binary Search**: Utilizes a logarithmic search approach for sorted arrays, drastically improving search performance.

## 💡 Why Adaptive Search?

This project addresses the challenge of searching through data by combining the simplicity of **linear search** with the efficiency of **binary search**. Whether the array is sorted or unsorted, this adaptive approach ensures optimal performance without requiring manual selection of the search method.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Input your data**: Add a list of numbers or elements into the array.
2. **Let the algorithm decide**: The adaptive algorithm will detect whether the array is sorted or unsorted and automatically apply the appropriate search method.
3. **Get Results**: The position of the searched element will be returned based on the search strategy.

## 📂 Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS**: For styling the web interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the adaptive search algorithm.
