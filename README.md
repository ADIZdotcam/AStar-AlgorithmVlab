# A*PathfindingVlab

### 🌐 My First Web Page

Welcome to **A*PathfindingVlab**, a Virtual Labs project designed to explore the **A* pathfinding algorithm**, a powerful search algorithm used for finding the shortest path between two points in a grid-based map.

---

## 🛠 Features

- **A* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Uses a heuristic approach combined with graph search to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal.
- **Heuristic Function**: Efficiently guides the search process by estimating the cost to reach the goal from a given point.
- **Dynamic Grid**: Visualizes the pathfinding process on a grid with obstacles, showcasing how A* adapts to different environments.

## 💡 Why A* Pathfinding?

This project demonstrates the power of the **A* pathfinding algorithm**, which combines the benefits of **Dijkstra's algorithm** (finding the shortest path) with a heuristic that makes it much faster by prioritizing the most promising paths first. It's widely used in games and robotics for navigation.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Create a Grid**: Define a grid with start and end points, and optionally add obstacles.
2. **Run the Algorithm**: The A* algorithm will calculate the shortest path considering both the distance and the heuristic.
3. **View the Path**: The algorithm visualizes the pathfinding process in real-time, showing how it navigates around obstacles and reaches the goal.
